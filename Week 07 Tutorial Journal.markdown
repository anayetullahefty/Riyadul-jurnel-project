## Task 2: View Wi-Fi Details

**AP Information**:
1. **AP 1**:
   - **SSID**: he!!o
   - **BSSID**: 58:11:22:14:43:0c
   - **Frequency Band**: 5 GHz
   - **Channel**: 11
   - **Data Rate**: 50 Mbps
2. **AP 2**:
   - **SSID**: Virous!
   - **BSSID**: 62:83:e7:22:ea:93
   - **Frequency Band**: 5 GHz
   - **Channel**: 48
   - **Data Rate**: 100 Mbps

## Task 3: Use Wi-Fi Access Point

**Important Settings and Considerations**:

1. **SSID**: Current: "HomeWiFi". Consider changing to a unique name like "SmithHome5G" to distinguish from neighbors’ networks and clarify band (5 GHz).
2. **Channel**: Current: Auto (2.4 GHz, Channel 6). For 2.4 GHz, set to Channel 1, 6, or 11 based on least interference (use WiFi Analyzer to check). For 5 GHz, set to a high channel (e.g., 149) to avoid radar interference.
3. **Security Mode**: Current: WPA2-PSK. Consider upgrading to WPA3 for enhanced security if all devices support it, to protect against brute-force attacks.
4. **Guest Network**: Current: Disabled. Enable a guest network with a separate SSID (e.g., "GuestWiFi") and limited access to enhance security for visitors.
5. **QoS**: Current: Disabled. Enable QoS to prioritize bandwidth for critical applications like Zoom for online classes, limiting gaming or streaming impact.

**Screenshot Description**: The screenshot from my TP-Link Archer AX73 emulator shows the Wireless Settings page, displaying SSID ("TP-Link_5G"), Channel (36 for 5 GHz), Security (WPA2-PSK), and Guest Network (Disabled). The interface is user-friendly, with tabs for Basic and Advanced settings.

## Task 4: Self-Evaluation of Teamwork

**Generative AI Prompt and Output**:

- **Prompt**: "List 5 ways to improve teamwork in a university group project."
- **Output**:
  1. Establish clear communication channels.
  2. Define roles and responsibilities early.
  3. Schedule regular team meetings.
  4. Use collaborative tools for task management.
  5. Foster a respectful and inclusive environment.

- **Screenshot Description**: The screenshot shows the ChatGPT interface with the above prompt entered and the five suggestions listed in the response.

**Comparison with Team Practices**:

1. **Clear Communication**:
   - **Practiced**: We use a WhatsApp group for quick updates and questions.
   - **Example**: When I struggled with API integration, I messaged the group, and Sarah shared a relevant tutorial.
2. **Defined Roles**:
   - **Practiced**: Roles were assigned in Week 3 (e.g., I’m coding the backend, John handles frontend).
   - **Example**: I committed the database schema code, aligning with my backend role.
3. **Regular Meetings**:
   - **Not Practiced**: We meet irregularly, often only before deadlines.
   - **Improvement**: Schedule weekly 30-minute Zoom meetings to review progress and plan tasks.
4. **Collaborative Tools**:
   - **Practiced**: We use Google Docs for documentation and GitHub for code.
   - **Example**: Our project report draft is in a shared Google Doc, edited by all members.
5. **Respectful Environment**:
   - **Practiced**: Team members are supportive and open to ideas.
   - **Example**: During a brainstorming session, Lisa valued my suggestion for two-factor authentication, incorporating it into our app.

**GitHub Commit Analysis**:

- **Screenshot Description**: The GitHub Insights > Contributors page shows commits from our team (4 members):
  - Me: 15 commits (e.g., backend API, database setup).
  - John: 12 commits (e.g., UI components).
  - Sarah: 8 commits (e.g., security features).
  - Lisa: 6 commits (e.g., documentation, testing).
- **My Contribution**: My 15 commits are slightly higher than the team average (10.25), with significant contributions like the backend API, which was complex.
- **Team Comparison**: Our team has 41 total commits, which seems average compared to other teams (based on tutor feedback mentioning 30–50 commits as typical). Contribution
